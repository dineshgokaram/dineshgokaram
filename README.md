### 🚀 About Me

I’m a Backend Developer from Hyderabad, India — passionate about building scalable systems and transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

From designing RESTful APIs with Django & FastAPI to crafting powerful ETL pipelines and data dashboards, I love solving real-world problems with code. I thrive in fast-paced environments, collaborate well in cross-functional teams, and never stop learning.

Currently, I’m helping Codec Technology India uncover insights from data as a **Data Analytics Intern**.
